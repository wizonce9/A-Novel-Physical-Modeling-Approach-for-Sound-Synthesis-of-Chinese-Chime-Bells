# A Novel Physical Modeling Approach for Sound Synthesis of Chinese Chime Bells

## Overview

This repository contains the modeling and sampling data of Chinese chime bells used in the research paper titled "A Novel Physical Modeling Approach for Sound Synthesis of Chinese Chime Bells". The sound synthesis data has been compiled into the **Kontakt format** for use in popular audio host software.

### Key Features:
- **Kontakt Audio Sources**: The audio data is in Kontakt format, which is widely used in audio production software.
- **Open Source**: The modeling and sound synthesis data are provided under an open-source license for further research and creative applications.
- **Support for Music Technology**: This project explores advanced sound synthesis techniques tailored for Chinese chime bells.

## Installation and Usage

To use the chime bell sound samples in your own project:

1. **Download the Repository**: Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wizonce9/A-Novel-Physical-Modeling-Approach-for-Sound-Synthesis-of-Chinese-Chime-Bells.git
    ```

2. **Install Kontakt**: Ensure that you have the latest version of **Kontakt** or any compatible software for using Kontakt instruments.

3. **Load Audio Sources**: Open the `.nki` files in the `Samples/` folder directly in Kontakt or through your audio host software (e.g., Ableton, Logic Pro, etc.).
